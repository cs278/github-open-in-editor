GitHub Open in Editor
=====================

The intention is to allow you to easily open files as you browse them on GitHub
in your editor of choice. This is accomplised by providing a browser extension
that adds an anchor to the GitHub interface with a special URI scheme. How you
handle translating a GitHub repo, branch, path into your editor is entirely up
to the end user.
